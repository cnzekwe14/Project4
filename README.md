##### Selected Topic: 
Overview: This project shows creating a  twitter sentiment analysis model using python. Twitter sentiment analysis is performed to identify the sentiments of the people towards various topics. For this project, we analyzed the sentiment of people towards the Ukraine Conflict.    We used the data available on Kaggle to create this machine learning model. The collected tweets from Twitter were analysed using machine learning to identify the different sentiments present in the tweets. The different sentiments identified in this project include positive sentiment, negative sentiment and neutral sentiment. We used different classifiers to see which classifier gives the best model accuracy.
We used VADER(Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) to perform sentiment analysis on texts gathered from Twitter. VADER is asimple rule-based model that was created specifically for sentiment analysis on social media. This is because it takes slangs, short words and emoticons into account.

## Goals:

*	Identify positive, negative and neutral tweets

*	Compare sentiment to dominant to identify the accuracy of the model
*	Visualize Most popular words from positive, neutral and negative
###### Data Sources:

Kaggle : Ukraine Conflict Twitter Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/ukraine-russian-crisis-twitter-dataset-1-2-m-rows )

The CSV file was downloaded from Kaggle Website which is stored in the Resources Folder. This file contains 47,994 rows and 29 columns. 
Null value rows and irrelevant columns also dropped to have a clean dataframe for analyses.
